Getting into VGC but only in the last month or so. I’ve played casually off and on for many years but I barely know the type chart.\nI don’t believe data analysis has all the answers. It may not even be all that useful for expert players. I’ve seen lots of bad data analysis on Pokemon that reinforces my belief that data science is a puerile discipline. However, I do think data analysis can help beginners like me climb the learning curve faster.\n\n\n\n",
